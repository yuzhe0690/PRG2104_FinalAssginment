# PRG2104_FinalAssginment
 Create a 2D game using Scala and ScalaFx

**Description:**
- This is the final project for my Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course at my university using Scala, ScalaFX, and SceneBuilder.

**Video Demonstration:**
- YT Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2xAmNNGEig

**How to Run:**
1. Have SBT installed and fully set up.
2. Download the repository and unzip it.
3. Once unzipped, open the folder.
4. In the folder, click the address bar and type sbt then hit the enter key.
5. A command prompt window should pop up and the sbt server will start.
6. Once the server started, type run and hit the enter key. This will compile the code and run the MainApp.scala.

**Goal:**
- This project aims to create a 2D game using Scala, ScalaFX, and SceneBuilder while using OOP practices.

**Game Chosen:**
- For this project, I will create a simple snake game with a proper collision detection method, a current score & highest session score, and display the player name in the game.
- Other than that, the game should be visually pleasing even though it uses simple graphics. 

**Game Features:**
- Collision detection algorithm, current & highest score, checker field background, scalable drawing method, and special head color for the snake.

**OOP Practices Used:**
- Inheritance, abstract classes, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

**Future Improvements:**
- Better UI design, implement difficulty levels, implement other obstacles (either a fixed amount or increase over time), leaderboard for the highest score, and use CSS to style the UI.

**Files & Folders**
- **_src/main_**: the main project file.
- **_build.sbt_**: the sbt build version used by the project (please use this build version when trying to run the project).
- **_src/main/resources/ch/makery/address/view_**: all of the scenes (fxml) created using SceneBuilder.
- **_src/main/scala/ch/makery/address/MainApp.scala_**: the main class that is used for running the entire game.
- **_src/main/scala/ch/makery/address/model_**: all of the logic and classes used by the game.
- **_src/main/scala/ch/makery/address/view_**: all of the controller classes assigned for their respective scenes.
