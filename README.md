# PRG2104_FinalAssginment
 Create a 2D game using Scala and ScalaFx

**Description:**
- This is the final project for my Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course at my university using Scala, ScalaFX, and SceneBuilder.

**Goal:**
- This project aims to create a 2D game using Scala, ScalaFX, and SceneBuilder while using OOP practices.

**Game Chosen:**
- For this project, I will create a simple snake game with a proper collision detection method, a current score & highest session score, and display the player name in the game.
- Other than that, the game should be visually pleasing even though it uses simple graphics. 

**Game Features:**
- Collision detection algorithm, current & highest score, checker field background, scalable drawing method, and special head color for the snake.

**OOP Practices Used:**
- Inheritance, abstract classes, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

**What Can Be Improved:**
- Better UI design, implement difficulty levels, implement other obstacles (either a fixed amount or increase over time), leaderboard for the highest score, and use CSS to style the UI.
